# ProxyScrape - Get

A simple python script to test for currently viable proxies from [proxyscrapes proxy list]('https://proxyscrape.com/free-proxy-list').

## Features

* Automatically removes empty and duplicate proxies
* checks proxies vs [Sofascore]('https://sofascore.com') probably one of the *strictest* anti bot platforms(if it works there, it'll work on most other platforms)
* returns viable proxies[TODO]
* verbose logging
